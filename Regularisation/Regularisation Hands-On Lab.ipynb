   "source": "# Regularisation: Hands-On Lab\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n\n1. **Understand** the problem of overfitting and how it manifests in machine learning models\n2. **Recognize** the bias-variance tradeoff and its relationship to model complexity\n3. **Implement** L2 (Ridge) regularization in logistic regression from scratch\n4. **Apply** regularization to prevent overfitting with polynomial features\n5. **Optimize** the regularization hyperparameter λ using cross-validation\n6. **Visualize** how regularization affects decision boundaries and model complexity\n7. **Compare** L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques\n\n## What is Regularisation?\n\n**Regularisation** is a technique to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages overly complex models.\n\n### The Overfitting Problem\n\nWithout regularization, complex models (e.g., high-degree polynomials) can fit training data perfectly but fail on new data:\n- **Training error**: Very low (model memorizes training data)\n- **Test error**: High (model fails to generalize)\n\n### Regularisation Solution\n\nAdd a penalty for large weights to the loss function:\n\n$$J_{\\text{regularized}}(\\vec{w}) = J_{\\text{original}}(\\vec{w}) + \\lambda R(\\vec{w})$$\n\nWhere:\n- $J_{\\text{original}}$ is the original loss (e.g., negative log-likelihood)\n- $R(\\vec{w})$ is the regularization term\n- $\\lambda \\geq 0$ is the regularization strength hyperparameter\n\n### Two Common Types\n\n**L2 Regularization (Ridge)**:\n$$J_{\\text{L2}}(\\vec{w}) = J(\\vec{w}) + \\lambda ||\\vec{w}||^2_2 = J(\\vec{w}) + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{d} w_j^2$$\n\n- Penalizes the **squared magnitude** of weights\n- Shrinks weights toward zero but rarely makes them exactly zero\n- Gradient: $\\nabla R(\\vec{w}) = 2\\lambda \\vec{w}$\n\n**L1 Regularization (Lasso)**:\n$$J_{\\text{L1}}(\\vec{w}) = J(\\vec{w}) + \\lambda ||\\vec{w}||_1 = J(\\vec{w}) + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{d} |w_j|$$\n\n- Penalizes the **absolute value** of weights\n- Can drive weights to **exactly zero** (feature selection)\n- Gradient: $\\nabla R(\\vec{w}) = \\lambda \\cdot \\text{sign}(\\vec{w})$\n\n### Key Intuition\n\n**Why does regularization prevent overfitting?**\n\nComplex models fit training data by using large weights to create sharp, wiggly decision boundaries. Regularization forces the model to use smaller weights, resulting in smoother, more generalizable boundaries. The model must balance fitting the training data well (low $J$) with keeping weights small (low $R$).\n\n**Example:**\n- Without regularization: $w = [0.1, 50.3, -45.2, 38.7]$ (large weights, overfits)\n- With regularization: $w = [0.1, 2.3, -1.8, 0.9]$ (small weights, generalizes)\n\n### The λ Hyperparameter\n\n- $\\lambda = 0$: No regularization (may overfit)\n- $\\lambda$ small: Light regularization\n- $\\lambda$ large: Heavy regularization (may underfit)\n- $\\lambda = \\infty$: All weights forced to zero (trivial model)\n\n**Finding optimal λ**: Use cross-validation to test different values and select the one with best validation performance.\n\n---"

Our dataset requires a curved boundary that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of $x_1$ and $x_2$ alone.\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\nA linear classifier can only create decision boundaries that are:\n- **2D**: Straight lines\n- **3D**: Flat planes  \n- **Higher dimensions**: Hyperplanes\n\nFor our mixture dataset:\n- The two classes are intermingled in a non-linear pattern\n- Optimal boundary requires curves or complex shapes\n- A straight line cannot separate the classes effectively\n\n**Visual example:**\n```\nLinear boundary:        Needed boundary:\n   |  O O O               O O O\n   |O  X  O            O    ⟲    O\n---*------          O    ⟲  X  O\n X | X O             O  X  ⟲  O\n  X|X O                 O O O\n```\n\n**Solution:** Use polynomial features to create non-linear terms:\n- Add $x_1^2, x_2^2, x_1x_2$ to features\n- Now the model can learn: $w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_1^2 + w_4x_2^2 + w_5x_1x_2 = 0$\n- This allows curved and complex decision boundaries\n\n**Why other answers are incorrect:**\n\n- **B is FALSE**: While feature normalization is a best practice for gradient descent convergence, it's not why linear models fail on this problem. Even with perfectly normalized features, a straight line cannot separate non-linearly distributed classes. Normalization helps with optimization speed and stability, but doesn't change the fundamental limitation of linear boundaries.\n\n- **C is FALSE**: Linear logistic regression works with any number of features (2, 3, 100, 10000, etc.). The limitation is not the number of features but the type of decision boundary (linear vs non-linear). In fact, we'll solve this problem by *adding* features (polynomial terms) while still using logistic regression.\n\n- **D is FALSE**: Gradient descent converges just fine on non-linear data. The negative log-likelihood loss function for logistic regression is convex, meaning there are no local minima - gradient descent will always reach the global optimum. The issue is that this optimum corresponds to the best *linear* boundary, which still can't separate non-linearly distributed classes effectively.\n\n</details>"

The modified loss is: $J_{\\text{total}} = J_{\\text{NLL}} + \\lambda||w||^2$. This forces the optimization to balance data fit with weight magnitude, resulting in smoother decision boundaries that generalize better.\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n**Without L2 regularization ($\\lambda = 0$):**\n- Loss function: $J = -\\sum [y \\log p + (1-y)\\log(1-p)]$\n- Goal: Minimize NLL only\n- Weights can grow arbitrarily large to perfectly fit training data\n- Result: Complex, wiggly boundaries that overfit\n\n**With L2 regularization ($\\lambda > 0$):**\n- Loss function: $J = -\\sum [y \\log p + (1-y)\\log(1-p)] + \\lambda\\sum w_j^2$\n- Goal: Minimize NLL AND keep weights small\n- Large weights are penalized quadratically\n- Result: Simpler boundaries, better generalization\n\n**Example with numbers:**\n\nConsider a model trying to fit a training point:\n```\nWithout regularization (λ=0):\n- Can use weights: w = [50, -45, 38] (magnitude = 77)\n- Training loss: 0.01 (perfect fit)\n- Test performance: poor (overfits)\n\nWith regularization (λ=1):\n- Forced to use: w = [2, -1.5, 1.2] (magnitude = 2.7)\n- Training loss: 0.15 (good but not perfect fit)\n- Test performance: good (generalizes)\n- Total loss: 0.15 + 1*(2.7²) = 0.15 + 7.3 = 7.45\n```\n\n**How gradient descent changes with L2:**\n\nStandard gradient: $\\nabla J = \\Phi^T(p - y)$\n\nWith L2: $\\nabla J = \\Phi^T(p - y) + 2\\lambda w$\n\nUpdate rule: $w \\leftarrow w - \\alpha[\\Phi^T(p-y) + 2\\lambda w] = (1-2\\alpha\\lambda)w - \\alpha\\Phi^T(p-y)$\n\nThe term $(1-2\\alpha\\lambda)w$ shrinks weights at each step (weight decay)!\n\n**Visual interpretation:**\n```\nWithout regularization:      With regularization:\n      O O O                      O O O\n    O  ←  O                    O       O\n   O   ↓   O                  O    X    O\n  O ← X → O                  O    X X   O\n   O   ↑  O                     O  X X O\n    O   O                         O O O\n   (wiggly, fits                (smooth,\n    every point)               generalizes)\n```\n\n**Effect of λ:**\n- λ = 0: No regularization, may overfit\n- λ small (0.01): Light penalty, slight smoothing\n- λ medium (1.0): Balanced, often optimal\n- λ large (100): Heavy penalty, may underfit (weights too small)\n\n**Why other answers are incorrect:**\n\n- **B is FALSE**: This describes L1 (Lasso) regularization, not L2 (Ridge). L1 uses $\\lambda \\sum |w_j|$ which has a gradient of $\\lambda \\cdot \\text{sign}(w)$, producing exactly zero weights (sparse solutions). L2 uses $\\lambda \\sum w_j^2$ with gradient $2\\lambda w$, which only asymptotically approaches zero but never reaches it. L2 shrinks all weights but doesn't perform feature selection.\n\n- **C is FALSE**: L2 regularization does not affect the learning rate $\\alpha$. The learning rate is a separate hyperparameter that controls step size in gradient descent. L2 regularization modifies the gradient itself by adding $2\\lambda w$, but the learning rate remains the same. Increasing the learning rate could actually make convergence worse, not better.\n\n- **D is FALSE**: This describes data augmentation or dropout, not L2 regularization. L2 regularization is a deterministic modification to the loss function - no randomness involved. The training data remains unchanged; only the optimization objective changes. Dropout (random neuron deactivation) and data augmentation (adding noisy copies) are different regularization techniques used primarily in neural networks.\n\n</details>"

    "### ✅ Checkpoint Question 6: What is the key difference between L1 and L2 regularization?\n",
    "\n",
    "A) L1 adds the absolute values of weights to the loss function and can drive weights to exactly zero performing feature selection, while L2 adds squared weights and only shrinks weights toward zero without making them exactly zero\n",
    "B) L1 regularization is used only for regression problems and linear models, while L2 regularization is exclusively designed for classification tasks with logistic regression\n",
    "C) L1 uses gradient descent optimization for training while L2 uses a closed-form analytical solution, making L2 much faster to compute for large datasets\n",
    "D) L1 and L2 are identical in their mathematical formulation and produce the same learned weights, they only differ in their implementation details and computational cost\n",

    "**Answer: A**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insight:** L1 and L2 regularization differ fundamentally in how they penalize weights. L1 uses absolute values ($\\sum |w_j|$), which produces sparse solutions (many exactly-zero weights), while L2 uses squared values ($\\sum w_j^2$), which produces small but non-zero weights. This difference makes L1 useful for feature selection and L2 useful for general overfitting prevention.\n",

    "## Best Practices and Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Always Use Regularization with Polynomial Features\n",
    "- Polynomial features create many features → high risk of overfitting\n",
    "- Start with moderate λ (e.g., 1.0) and tune via cross-validation\n",
    "- Monitor train vs test accuracy to detect overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Feature Scaling is Critical\n",
    "- Always standardize features before applying regularization\n",
    "- Regularization penalizes all weights equally\n",
    "- Without scaling, features with large scales dominate\n",
    "```python\n",
    "scaler = StandardScaler()\n",
    "X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\n",
    "X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Don't Regularize the Bias Term\n",
    "- The intercept/bias should not be penalized\n",
    "- It just shifts the decision boundary\n",
    "- In our implementation: `gradient[0]` excludes regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Use Cross-Validation for λ Selection\n",
    "- Test multiple λ values: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100]\n",
    "- Use k-fold CV on training data only\n",
    "- Never use test set for hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Start with L2, Consider L1 for Feature Selection\n",
    "- **L2 (Ridge)**: Default choice, works well in most cases\n",
    "- **L1 (Lasso)**: Use when you need sparse models\n",
    "- **Elastic Net**: Combines L1 + L2 benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Early Stopping as Alternative\n",
    "- Stop training when validation error starts increasing\n",
    "- Prevents overfitting without modifying loss\n",
    "- Common in neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Regularization vs More Data\n",
    "- Regularization: Works with fixed dataset\n",
    "- More data: Best solution but often not available\n",
    "- Use both when possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Debugging Checklist\n",
    "- ✅ Training accuracy much higher than test? → Increase λ\n",
    "- ✅ Both accuracies low? → Decrease λ or increase model complexity\n",
    "- ✅ Loss increasing? → Decrease learning rate\n",
    "- ✅ Weights exploding? → Increase λ or decrease learning rate"
