        "### 2. Learning Rate Selection\n",
        "- Start with α = 0.01 for normalized features\n",
        "- If loss increases or oscillates: reduce α\n",
        "- If convergence is too slow: increase α\n",
        "- Monitor loss curve to diagnose\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Handling Class Imbalance\n",
        "- Use stratified splits: `train_test_split(..., stratify=y)`\n",
        "- Consider weighted loss or resampling\n",
        "- Focus on precision/recall instead of accuracy\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Convergence\n",
        "- Set reasonable `max_iter` (e.g., 1000-10000)\n",
        "- Use `tol` to stop early when gradient is small\n",
        "- Check if loss is still decreasing\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Multiclass Classification\n",
        "For more than 2 classes, use:\n",
        "- One-vs-Rest (OvR): Train C binary classifiers\n",
        "- Softmax regression (multinomial logistic regression)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Regularization\n",
        "To prevent overfitting:\n",
        "- L2 regularization: Add $\\lambda ||\\vec{w}||^2$ to loss\n",
        "- L1 regularization: Add $\\lambda ||\\vec{w}||_1$ to loss\n",
