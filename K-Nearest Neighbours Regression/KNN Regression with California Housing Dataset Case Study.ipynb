    "# Case Study: KNN Regression with California Housing Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "K‑Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm that can be applied to both classification and regression tasks. In **regression**, instead of voting for a class label, KNN predicts a continuous value by **averaging** the target values of the K nearest neighbors. In this case study, we'll step through a practical example using the **California Housing** dataset to illustrate key concepts and best practices of KNN regression. This dataset contains information about housing blocks in California from the 1990 census, with 8 features (e.g., median income, house age, average rooms, location) and a target variable representing the median house value.\n",

Deviations show where the model struggles.\n\n2. **Percentage Error Plot (right)**: Shows prediction errors as a percentage of actual values. Using percentage error instead of absolute error provides better insights:\n   - **Removes scale dependency**: A $50k error on a $500k house (10%) is very different from a $50k error on a $100k house (50%)\n   - **Prevents fan-out pattern**: Absolute residuals often increase with predicted values; percentage errors should be more evenly distributed\n   - **Easier interpretation**: We can quickly identify if errors are acceptable (e.g., within ±20%)\n\n**What to look for:** Ideally, percentage errors should be randomly scattered around zero with no clear patterns. Systematic patterns (e.g., consistent over/under-prediction for certain price ranges) suggest model limitations.",

   "source": "## Limitations and Advanced Topics\n\n### Current Scope Limitations\n\n**1. Single Hold-Out Validation**  \nThis notebook uses a **single train/validation/test split**, which is simple but has drawbacks:\n- Performance estimates depend on the specific random split\n- Small datasets may have high variance in estimates\n- We might get \"lucky\" or \"unlucky\" with our particular validation set\n\n**Better Approach: K-Fold Cross-Validation**  \nInstead of one validation set, k-fold CV:\n- Splits training data into k folds (typically k=5 or k=10)\n- Trains k models, each using k-1 folds for training and 1 fold for validation\n- Averages performance across all k folds for more robust estimates\n- Reduces dependence on any single data split\n\nExample code structure:\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n\npipe = Pipeline([('scaler', StandardScaler()), \n                 ('knn', KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=7))])\nscores = cross_val_score(pipe, X_train, y_train, cv=5, \n                         scoring='neg_root_mean_squared_error')\nprint(f\"CV RMSE: {-scores.mean():.3f} (+/- {scores.std():.3f})\")\n```\n\n**2. Brute-Force Neighbor Search**  \nWe used sklearn's default brute-force algorithm, which works well for small/medium datasets but doesn't scale. For large datasets, consider:\n- **KD-Trees**: Efficient for low-dimensional data (d < 20)\n- **Ball Trees**: Better for higher dimensions than KD-trees\n- **Approximate methods**: FAISS, Annoy, HNSW for millions of points\n\n**3. Additional Considerations**\n- **Distance-weighted KNN**: Use `weights='distance'` to give closer neighbors more influence\n- **Outlier handling**: KNN averages can be affected by extreme target values\n- **Feature engineering**: Interaction or polynomial features might improve performance\n- **Ensemble methods**: Combine KNN with other models for better robustness\n- **Curse of dimensionality**: KNN performance degrades in very high dimensions (d > 50)"

   "source": "## Conclusion and Key Takeaways\n\n### What We Learned\n\n1. **Feature scaling is non-negotiable** for KNN. Without it, features with larger ranges dominate distance calculations and render other features useless.\n\n2. **Hyperparameter tuning requires careful validation.** Using train/validation/test splits (or cross-validation) prevents overfitting to a specific data subset.\n\n3. **K controls the bias-variance tradeoff.** Small K leads to high variance (overfitting), large K leads to high bias (underfitting). Tune K systematically using validation data.\n\n4. **Multiple evaluation metrics** (RMSE, MAE, R², MAPE, percentage errors) provide different perspectives on model performance and help identify specific weaknesses.\n\n5. **Error patterns reveal model limitations.** High ambiguity regions (neighbors with diverse targets) produce larger errors—understanding where KNN struggles is as important as measuring overall performance.\n\n### When to Use KNN Regression\n\n**✅ KNN is a Good Choice When:**\n\n- **Small to medium datasets** (< 100K samples) where prediction latency isn't critical\n- **Non-linear relationships** exist between features and target (KNN makes no linearity assumptions)\n- **You need an interpretable baseline** before trying complex models\n- **Feature interactions are complex** and difficult to engineer explicitly\n- **You want quick prototyping** without extensive hyperparameter tuning\n- **Local patterns matter** more than global trends\n\n**❌ Avoid KNN When:**\n\n- **Large datasets** (millions of rows) where prediction time becomes prohibitive\n- **Real-time predictions** are required with strict latency requirements (< 10ms)\n- **High-dimensional data** (d > 50) due to the curse of dimensionality\n- **Features have no natural distance metric** (e.g., categorical data, text)\n- **Interpretability of individual predictions** is critical (KNN doesn't explain why it made a specific prediction beyond \"these are the nearest neighbors\")\n- **Memory constraints exist** (KNN stores entire training set)\n\n### Comparison with Other Regression Models\n\n| Model | Training Speed | Prediction Speed | Interpretability | Handles Non-linearity | Scales to Large Data |\n|-------|---------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| **KNN** | Instant | Slow | Medium | Yes | No |\n| **Linear Regression** | Fast | Fast | High | No | Yes |\n| **Random Forest** | Slow | Fast | Medium | Yes | Yes |\n| **Gradient Boosting** | Very Slow | Fast | Low | Yes | Yes |\n| **Neural Networks** | Very Slow | Fast | Very Low | Yes | Yes |\n\n### Next Steps\n\nKNN regression is an excellent **baseline model** that provides intuition about distance-based prediction. After establishing this baseline:\n\n1. Try **tree-based ensembles** (Random Forest, XGBoost) for better performance on most tabular data\n2. Experiment with **feature engineering** to capture domain knowledge\n3. Use **cross-validation** for more robust hyperparameter selection\n4. Consider **model stacking** that combines KNN with other regressors\n5. For production systems with large data, explore **approximate nearest neighbor** methods\n\n**Remember:** Simple models like KNN often provide surprising performance and valuable insights—don't immediately jump to complex deep learning without establishing a solid baseline first."
