    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We've walked through all the computational steps of KNN Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Visualized data** - saw training points in 2D space\n",
    "2. ✅ **Calculated distances** - computed Euclidean distance from test point to each training point\n",
    "3. ✅ **Found K nearest neighbors** - used `argsort()` to find indices of 5 closest points\n",
    "4. ✅ **Made prediction** - used majority voting among the K neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key NumPy Operations Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`pairwise_distances(X_test, X_train)`** - efficiently calculates all distances\n",
    "- **`.ravel()`** - flattens 2D array to 1D\n",
    "- **`np.argsort(distances)`** - returns indices that would sort the array\n",
    "- **`array[indices]`** - fancy indexing to select multiple elements\n",
    "- **`np.unique(labels, return_counts=True)`** - counts occurrences of each value\n",
    "- **`np.argmax(counts)`** - finds index of maximum value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Both Approaches?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loop versions** help you understand the logic step-by-step\n",
    "- **Vectorized versions** are much faster for large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, use vectorized operations, but understanding loops helps you know what's happening under the hood!"
