    "# Sentiment Analysis of US Airline Tweets Using Deep Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis, a key task in natural language processing (NLP), involves identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text to determine the writer's sentiment—whether positive, neutral, or negative. This study focuses on analyzing the sentiment of tweets related to US airlines, aiming to classify them into these three categories. Sentiment analysis on social media data, such as tweets, presents unique challenges due to the informal language, use of slang, emojis, sarcasm, and the brevity of the messages. For instance, a tweet might convey a sentiment that is not straightforward, making it difficult for traditional methods to accurately capture the intended emotional tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's digital age, social media platforms like Twitter have become crucial channels for customers to voice their opinions and experiences with companies, including airlines. Understanding customer sentiment from these platforms allows airlines to gain real-time insights into customer satisfaction and potential issues. This ability to swiftly analyze and respond to customer feedback is vital, as studies have shown that 67% of customers use social media for customer service. Effective sentiment analysis can enable airlines to proactively address problems, enhance customer satisfaction, and build stronger brand loyalty. The goal of this study is to develop a reliable and scalable method for automating sentiment analysis, tailored to the unique characteristics of social media data, which can help airlines improve their services and gain a competitive edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this study is the \"Twitter US Airline Sentiment\" dataset from Kaggle. This dataset consists of 14,640 tweets directed at various US airlines, each labeled as positive, neutral, or negative. The distribution of sentiment labels is approximately 16% positive, 63% negative, and 21% neutral, highlighting a significant class imbalance. The tweets have already undergone basic preprocessing steps, such as the removal of duplicates and irrelevant information. The class imbalance in this dataset poses a challenge for model training, requiring careful selection of evaluation metrics and techniques to ensure that the models perform robustly across all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints and Methodological Focus\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is guided by the principles outlined in *Deep Learning with Python* by François Chollet, specifically adhering to \"The Universal Workflow of Machine Learning.\" Within this framework, we are constrained by the requirement to use only Dense layers, Dropout layers, and L1/L2 regularization techniques in our neural network models. We are restricted from using more advanced techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or methods like Early Stopping. Despite these constraints, our exploration will focus on various dense neural network architectures, including wider, deeper, and regularized models, to determine their effectiveness in sentiment classification. This exploration will provide insights into how different architectural choices impact model performance, particularly in handling the class imbalance present in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objectives of this study are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing:** To preprocess the text data, converting it into a numerical format that can be effectively utilized by machine learning models. This involves techniques like tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and handling class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Development and Exploration:** To develop and train dense neural network models for sentiment classification, exploring various network architectures. This includes experimenting with wider and deeper models, as well as applying Dropout and L1/L2 regularization techniques to understand their impact on model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance Evaluation:** To rigorously evaluate the performance of these models using a range of metrics, including accuracy, F1 Score, and AUC, with a particular focus on understanding how these models handle the class imbalance in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Optimization:** To investigate and implement techniques such as Dropout and L1/L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the models, given the constraints of not using CNNs, RNNs, or Early Stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Architectural Insights:** To analyze and compare the performance of different neural network architectures, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach within the given constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "These objectives aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of dense neural networks in handling sentiment analysis tasks, while also exploring how different architectural choices impact performance.\n",

Key observations:\n\n### Baseline Model (SLP)\n\n- The baseline Single Layer Perceptron (no hidden layers) achieves strong performance, demonstrating that even a simple linear classifier can capture much of the signal in TF-IDF features.\n- Training converges smoothly without overfitting, as expected for a model with limited capacity.\n\n### Overfitting Model (Section 5)\n\n- Adding a hidden layer (64 neurons) increases model capacity.\n- The training history shows clear overfitting: validation loss increases after ~110 epochs while training loss continues to decrease.\n- This confirms the model has **sufficient capacity** to memorise the training data, justifying the need for regularisation.\n\n### Regularised Model (64 neurons + Dropout + L2)\n\n- Hyperband found optimal regularisation hyperparameters automatically.\n- The regularised model shows improved generalisation: validation loss stabilises instead of increasing.\n- F1-Score improves over the baseline, indicating better performance on minority classes.\n\n### Architecture Variants\n\n| Architecture | Observation |\n|--------------|-------------|\n| **Wider (128)** | Marginal improvement over 64 neurons; extra capacity not needed |\n| **Deeper (64×2)** | Similar performance; hierarchical features don't help for TF-IDF |\n| **Narrower (32)** | Slight decrease; 32 neurons may underfit slightly |\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe baseline model already has sufficient statistical power to learn the patterns in TF-IDF features. Adding complexity (wider/deeper) provides diminishing returns. **Regularisation** (Dropout + L2) is more valuable than architectural changes for this task.\n\n> *\"When your baseline can already overfit, the answer is regularisation, not more capacity.\"* — Chollet (2021)"

This aligns with the principle: *\"Regularise, don't expand.\"*\n\n4. **Hyperband is efficient:** Automated hyperparameter tuning found good regularisation settings without exhaustive grid search.\n\n5. **Class weights matter:** For this imbalanced dataset (3.88:1 ratio), class weights were essential for learning minority classes effectively.\n\n### Limitations\n\n- Constrained to Dense layers only (no CNNs/RNNs/Transformers)\n- TF-IDF loses word order information\n- No early stopping used (per assignment constraints)\n\n### Future Work\n\n- **Early stopping** and **learning rate scheduling** could improve training efficiency\n- **LIME** or **SHAP** for model interpretability\n- **Pre-trained embeddings** (Word2Vec, BERT) could capture semantic relationships better than TF-IDF\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n- Chollet, F.
